However, as the website's capabilities expanded to include functionalities like downloading Instagram photos and videos, we sought a more adaptable hosting solution. That's when we turned to Blogspot.com. While it offered free hosting, a custom domain, and SSL certification, we encountered limitations in theme customization and design flexibility. Driven by the need for more creative freedom, we ventured further and discovered the versatility of Netlify. What stood out was its seamless integration with Git platforms like GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket. Utilizing webhooks, Netlify effortlessly triggers builds upon code pushes, automatically deploying changes to production, all at zero cost. The agility of its deployment process deserves special mention, a testament to Netlify's efficiency. The additional perks of Netlify include support for custom domains and free SSL via Let's Encrypt. These features are invaluable for personal blogs and small websites, enhancing their security and credibility. Recently, the integration of Hugo into our blog posts revolutionized our theming options, offering an array of aesthetic choices right out of the box. The migration from Blogspot was surprisingly swift. Within just an hour, we were able to set up files and transition blog posts to Hugo in the Markdown format. That's all it took to make the switch.
